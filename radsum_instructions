           IOFF,   JDEL,   NANG,   NLEV,   TBND,    ILACIS
   
            1-5,   6-10,  11-15,  16-20,  20-28,     29-34
   
             I5,     I5,     I5,     I5,   F8.1,        I5
   
                IOFF    Output wavenumber offset from initial point V1P
   
                JDEL    Ratio of output spacing to input spacing

                NANG    Number of angles (Maximum of 3)

                NLEV    Number of levels
                          For NLEV < 0, number of layers + 1 from input binary file header is used

                TBND    Surface Temperature in K
                          For TBND < 0, surface temperature from input binary file header is used

                ILACIS  Flag for angle weights

                           0  use standard weights
                           1  use weights for Lacis angles
