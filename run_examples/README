Calculation of fluxes and heating rates from LBLRTM output radiances

IMPORTANT! In order for the example to run smoothly, the user must also download
the LBLRTM, LNFL and AER line files packages. Each package should be installed at
the same directory level as RADSUM, i.e., the user should have a directory
containing RADSUM, LBLRTM, LNFL and the line files (aer_v3.6 currently).

LBLRTM 
Input file: TAPE5.sample (profile, scan parameters, etc.)
Output files: ODdeflt_01, etc. (optical depths by layer)
              TAPE31, TAPE32, TAPE33, TAPE61, TAPE62, TAPE63 (radiances)

RADSUM 
Input files: IN_RADSUM (control parameters)
             TAPE31, TAPE32, TAPE33, TAPE61, TAPE62, TAPE63 (radiances)
Output file: OUTPUT_RADSUM


LBLRTM steps: 
The file TAPE5.sample is a sample TAPE5 for running flux and cooling
rate calculations with LBLRTM (see the lblrtm_instructions file
distributed with LBLRTM for more information).  The atmosphere and
spectral range can be changed as required.  Following the optical
depth computations are six additional LBL runs which correspond to the
three angles and two directions (up and down) for the calculation.
The six output files TAPE31, TAPE32, TAPE33, TAPE61, TAPE62, and
TAPE63 contain the binary radiance output for all layers with one file
for each direction and angle.  For the optical depth calculation and
the scan merges, it is recommended that the desired spectral interval
be padded with a couple of wavenumbers at either end as shown in
TAPE5.sample.  (Note that the downwelling scan merges can be quite
slow for profiles with many layers). It is important that the angles
chosen for the flux LBL runs match the quadrature angles specified in
RADSUM, either Gaussian first order or the quadrature used by RRTM. 
Furthermore the emissivity values chosen for LBLRTM must also be used 
for RADSUM.


RADSUM steps:
Radsum.f is used to read the binary output from LBLRTM to compute the
fluxes.  Compile this with build/make_radsum, noting that an additional
utility source module of the type distributed with lblrtm
(e.g. 'util_linux_pgi.f') is required.  Also, radsum.f must be compiled with
the same compiler options as used with LBLRTM (single vs. double
precision in particular) for the input radiances to be read correctly.

The input file for radsum.f, IN_RADSUM, specifies the output resolution
(i.e. you can integrate over the whole spectral range, or write out at
10 cm-1 intervals, for example).  The format for IN_RADSUM is outlined
in 'docs/radsum_instructions'.  Note that the resolution of the radiance
output files (TAPE31, etc.) is 0.5 cm-1 since the HWHM in the LBLRTM TAPE5
was specified as 0.25 (there is no need to change this). Therefore your 
RADSUM output resolution always has to be a multiple of 0.5, and this ratio is
specified in IN_RADSUM with the variable OUTINRAT.  OUTINRAT is 3980 in
the example to integrate over the whole 320 cm-1 range from 10 to 2000
cm-1.  OUTINRAT of 20 would integrate and write the fluxes at
intervals of 10 cm-1.
