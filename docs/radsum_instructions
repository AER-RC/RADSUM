         INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLUX AND HEATING RATE CALCULATIONS WITH LBLRTM 

				 PROGRAM: RADSUM
                              INPUT FILE: IN_RADSUM
   
RECORD 1
      
          V1,   V2,    OUTINRAT,   NANG,   NLEV,   TBND,   IQUAD
   
         1-10  11-20    21-25      26-30   31-35   36-43   44-48
   
        F10.2  F10.2      I5        I5      I5      F8.1     I5
   
	V1		The beginning wavenumber of the first output group

	V2		The ending wavenumber of the final output group

	OUTINRAT	The ratio of the DV of each output group to the
			incoming DV
	
        NANG 		Number of angles (Maximum of 3)

        NLEV    	Number of levels
                          	For NLEV < 0, number of layers + 1 from 
				input binary file header is used

        TBND    	Surface Temperature in K
                          	For TBND < 0, surface temperature from 
				input binary file header is used

        IQUAD  		Flag for quadrature method
                           	0 - standard first-order quadrature
                           	1 - quadrature weights associated with
					three angles used in RRTM

	Restrictions:  	V2 - V1 divided by OUTINRAT * (incoming DV) must be
			an integer (equals the number of output groups).

RECORD 2 
      
          V1,   V2,    OUTINRAT   
   
         1-10  11-20    21-25      
   
        F10.2  F10.2      I5       

	Same descriptions and restrictions apply as above. There should be
	one of these records for each additional desired set of output groups.

	NOTE:  V1 = -1. indicates the end of input.
